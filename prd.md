Objective: To establish Hiqba as a top-tier creative partner through a high-performance, visually stunning website that showcases expertise in both physical (printing/signage) and digital (marketing/web) spaces.🎨 Visual Identity & PalettePrimary Navy: #1E214D (The deep base from the logo)Accent Gradient: #00AEEF to #00E0FF (The cyan "swoosh" color)Typography: * Headings: A sharp, geometric Sans-Serif (e.g., Montserrat or Archivo).Body: A clean, light-weight Sans (e.g., Inter or Lexend).🏛️ Homepage Structure (Section by Section)1. The Hero: "The First Impression"Concept: Dark mode background (Deep Navy).Visual: A high-quality, slow-motion video loop in the background showing a mix of a digital interface being coded and a 3D signage letter being polished.Headline: Where Vision Meets Execution.Sub-headline: Premium Branding, Printing, and Digital Solutions for the Modern Era.CTA: [Explore Our Work] (Outline button with a gradient hover effect).2. The Service Grid: "The Creative Arena"Instead of a standard list, use a bento-box style grid with interactive cards:Branding & Design: Interactive logo reveals.Digital Marketing & Web: Live preview snippets of dashboards.Printing & 3D Works: High-res macro photography of textures (gold foil, matte acrylic).Video Editing: A hover-to-play video reel.3. The "Hiqba Advantage" (The Swoosh Element)Design: Use a large, animated SVG of the cyan "swoosh" from the logo that snakes down the page as the user scrolls, acting as a visual guide between sections.Content: Brief stats—10+ Years Experience, 500+ Projects, 100% Quality Guarantee.4. Portfolio Showcase: "Selected Works"Layout: Large, full-width "horizontal scroll" section.Interaction: As the user scrolls vertically, the projects slide horizontally. This feels very premium and high-end.🖱️ Interactive Cursor PRDTo give the site a "Premium" feel, we will replace the default system cursor with a custom, high-end version.FeatureSpecificationDefault StateA small, 8px solid Cyan dot.Outer RingA thin 30px circle border that follows the dot with a slight "lag" (spring physics) to feel organic.Hover State (Buttons)The inner dot disappears; the outer ring expands to 60px and turns White/Invert color. A "View" or "Click" text appears inside the ring in tiny caps.Image HoverWhen hovering over portfolio items, the cursor transforms into a "Drag" icon or shows the project name.Click AnimationOn click, the cursor emits a small "ripple" effect in the brand’s gradient colors.🛠️ Technical RecommendationsFramework: Next.js or Webflow for smooth animations.Animations: GSAP (GreenSock) for the "swoosh" scroll-trigger and Locomotive Scroll for smooth "inertia" scrolling.Performance: All images should be WebP format; video backgrounds must be under 5MB or hosted via Vimeo/Mux for instant loading.
